Design shortcomings
- I used nodejs express for my server which is overkill for this no-server project.
    - I could have simply used something like https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server
- Included scripts in the head. Might be more appropriate to include d3 in the body
- No coffeescript
- Could have pulled the data in via backend api to demonstrate how to access data via urls
- Could have written css for styling rather than hardcoded.
- progress text is broken / won't update
- create multiple svg with each data update
- wanted to add a slider for expected and actual. Would have made UX better and bounded the data between 0 and 1
- wanted to change the fonts
